•	External Disputes Resolution.

Internal Disputes Resolution Scheme
Our internal complaints handling system is easy to understand and in plain English. Free Will Finance Pty Ltd will make every effort to ensure that the client has every opportunity to express their concern and complaint.

•	Write a letter addressed to Level 7, 492 St Kilda Road, Melbourne,  VIC   3004

•	Upon receipt of a concern or complaint we will discuss the issue with you and undertake any necessary investigation to resolve the issue.
•	All client complaints must be responded to within 24hrs of receipt of the initial complaint.
•	Unless unforeseeable circumstances arise, all client complaints are to be resolved within 30 days of receipt.
